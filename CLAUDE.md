AEMO_spot is the directory where I am developing a dashboard that updates and provides electricity price and generation data. The data is mostly obtained from Nemweb. The main files at the moment are '/Users/davidleitch/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/snakeplay/AEMO_spot/aemo-spot-dashboard/update_spot.py' and '/Users/davidleitch/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/snakeplay/AEMO_spot/aemo-spot-dashboard/display_spot.py'. These programs download prices every 5 minutes and then display them.

Another file '/Users/davidleitch/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/snakeplay/AEMO_spot/genhist/gen_dash.py' downloads and displays generation data by fuel class.

gen_dash is supposed to send me emails for missing DUIDs but at the moment I'm not receiving emails.

I don't want to mess with the running code right now, but I think I would like to move the three files and their development up to my git_hub account in a fresh repository  maybe put them all in in the one uv environment. 

1. Then I would like to fix the email functionality. 
2. Then I would like to move one of the figures in the gen dash, the one that displays capacity utilisation to a separate tab in the app. In due course there will be more tabs and more components to the dashboard. 
3. Then I would like to add transmission flows into the generation by fuel class treating the net flow into or out of a region as a fuel like batteries that can either be positive(inflow) or negative(outflow). 
4. The logs for all the code can be written to the one log file. This will make it easier to 

Before making significant changes to the code you will review the latest official holoviz panel documentation. The dashboard and its components should use the "material " template as discussed in a recent holoviz blog post. In addition generally when presenting data in tables try to use the latest version of the tabulator widget within the dashboard.

When we start a session you will yourself do a fresh review of the code to make yourself familiar with its functionality

Before making substantial changes to code check with me and use good git procedure so that we can revert to earlier versions.
	Before making substantial changes to code or implementing new functionality think carefully and make a detailed plan with check box stages.
	If you have 2 or 3 goes at a task but it still doesnt work. Pause think carefully, go back to the documentation and consider carefully whether the approach is correct or whether an alternative approach might be better. After considering an alternative again think carefully whether it really is better.

Since electricity volume is extensive and is updated every 5 minutes I generally prefer to keep it in parquet files.
When changes are made to the dashboard run the dashboard at local host and look at the output, possibly using playwright to make sure its readable and has the functionality we designed.

There will be more added to the dashboard over time.

## About transmission

To access 5-minute transmission flow data from the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), you can utilize the NEMWeb platform, which provides detailed dispatch data, including interconnector flows.

### **Accessing 5-Minute Interconnector Flow Data**

The primary source for 5-minute interconnector flow data is the DISPATCHINTERCONNECTORRES table. This dataset includes: 

- **METEREDMWFLOW**: Actual measured flow in megawatts (MW) from SCADA systems.
- **MWFLOW**: Target flow for the upcoming 5-minute interval.
- **EXPORTLIMIT** and **IMPORTLIMIT**: Calculated limits for energy export and import.
- **MWLOSSES**: Calculated losses in MW. 

This data is updated every 5 minutes and is publicly accessible. 

### **Retrieving the Data**

You can download the dispatch data files from AEMO's NEMWeb portal. The files are available in ZIP format and contain CSV files with the relevant data. The filenames typically follow this pattern:()

PUBLIC_DISPATCHIS_YYYYMMDDHHMM_*.ZIP

### **Automating Data Retrieval**

To automate the process of downloading and storing this data every 5 minutes, you can write a script in a programming language like Python. Here's a basic outline:

1. **Set up a scheduler**: Use a task scheduler (like cron on Unix systems) to run your script every 5 minutes.()
2. **Download the latest file**: Your script should construct the URL for the latest dispatch file based on the current date and time, then download and extract the ZIP file.()
3. **Parse the CSV**: Extract the DISPATCHINTERCONNECTORRES data from the CSV file. 
4. **Store the data**: Save the extracted data to your local storage or a database for further analysis.()

Ensure your script includes error handling to manage potential issues like network errors or missing files.()

### **Additional Resources**

- **MMS Data Model Report**: Provides detailed information on the structure and fields of the DISPATCHINTERCONNECTORRES table. 
- **AEMO's Dispatch Data Page**: Offers access to various dispatch-related datasets and documentation.

## Dashboard Control Commands

### Restart Dashboard
```bash
# Kill existing dashboard process
pkill -f "python -m aemo_dashboard"

# Start dashboard (run from src directory)
cd "/Users/davidleitch/Library/Mobile Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/snakeplay/AEMO_spot/aemo-energy-dashboard/src" && uv run python -m aemo_dashboard.generation.gen_dash &
```

### Dashboard URLs
- Main dashboard: http://localhost:5010
- Dashboard title: "Nem Analysis" 
- Footer: "Last Updated: [time] | data:AEMO, design ITK"
- Four main tabs: Generation by Fuel | Average Price Analysis | Station Analysis

### Troubleshooting
- If port 5010 is in use: `lsof -ti:5010 | xargs kill -9`
- Check logs: `tail -f /Users/davidleitch/Library/Mobile\ Documents/com~apple~CloudDocs/snakeplay/AEMO_spot/aemo-energy-dashboard/logs/aemo_dashboard.log`

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Station vs DUID Selection Architecture
```python
# DUID pattern recognition for station grouping
import re
match = re.match(r'^(.+?)(\d+)$', duid)
base_name = match.group(1)  # "ER" from "ER01", "GSTONE" from "GSTONE1"

# Multi-DUID data aggregation  
filter_target = ['ER01', 'ER02', 'ER03', 'ER04']  # Station mode
filter_target = 'ER01'  # DUID mode
```

### Data Integration Pipeline
- **Generation Data:** 5-minute SCADA values from AEMO dispatch
- **Price Data:** Regional reference prices (RRP) from spot market
- **DUID Mapping:** Station names, capacities, fuel types, ownership
- **Revenue Calculation:** Generation × Price × (5/60) hours

### Chart Implementation
- **Dual-Axis:** Bokeh with extra_y_ranges and LinearAxis
- **Time Series:** Smart hourly resampling for >2 day periods
- **Interactivity:** Linked zooming, hover tooltips, legend toggle

## Recent Major Achievements ✅

### All Critical Issues Resolved
- ✅ **Station Aggregation:** DUID-based grouping more reliable than site names
- ✅ **Date Controls:** Working properly for both station and DUID modes  
- ✅ **Dual-Axis Charts:** Proper Bokeh implementation with color-coded axes
